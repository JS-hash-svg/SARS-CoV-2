### natural sequence variation of sarbecovirus spike

[Letko, Marzi, and Munster (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0688-y) curated an alignment of coronavirus spike proteins from sarbecovirus clade, which includes SARS-CoV-1, -2, and other bat isolates.
They choose spike sequences which have _unique_ RBD variants.
More information can be found in [Extended Data Fig 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0688-y/figures/6).

Here we display data from these natural sequences plus two pangolin spike sequences from [Lam _et al._ (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2169-0).

At the mutation level, we show the frequency of each amino acid in this alignment.
At the site level, we show the entropy and number of effective amino acids for each site based on the amino-acid frequencies from this alignment.

We are displaying this data on the spike structure [6vyb.pdb](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6VYB).
The full alignment we used can be found [HERE](github.com/dms-view/).
